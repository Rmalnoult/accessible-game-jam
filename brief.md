Accessible Game Jam – Project Brief

Overview

Accessible Game Jam is a web-based single-player mini-game where users earn points by fixing accessibility errors on a fictitious user interface. It gamifies web accessibility knowledge, allowing players to identify and correct common accessibility issues in a fun, interactive way. The goal is to educate and test users on the European accessibility standards set to be enforced by 2025, in line with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines ￼, all without boring the player. The app will be mobile-first, responsive, and built with the Shadcn Nuxt component library for an accessible and modern UI. There is no need for user accounts, persistent data, or leaderboards – the focus is on quick, engaging, single-session play.

Key Objectives:
	•	Educational Gamification: Teach users about web accessibility by having them find and fix errors, turning learning into a game.
	•	Standards Compliance: Base the game’s content on common issues from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA), as required by the European Accessibility Act 2025 ￼. Users will learn practical fixes that align with these standards.
	•	Mobile-First Good UX: Ensure the design is optimized for mobile devices (small screens) first, then scales up to larger screens. Provide a clean, intuitive UI/UX with clear instructions, feedback, and accessible components (using Shadcn Nuxt’s pre-built accessible components).
	•	No External Dependencies: The game runs entirely client-side. No database or login is required – all state (score, progress) is held in memory (or local storage if needed) for the session. This simplifies development and respects privacy.
	•	Accessibility of the App: The application itself will exemplify good accessibility practices – e.g., proper alt text, keyboard navigability, focus indicators, sufficient contrast – to model the standards it’s teaching. (Note: special care will be taken in how “intentional” accessibility errors are presented in-game to ensure that players with disabilities can still participate in the learning experience.)

Features and Requirements
	•	Responsive Web App: Develop as a responsive web application (HTML5/CSS3/JS) with mobile-first design. The layout and interactions should work smoothly on small touch screens and scale up to desktop. Use flexible layouts, media queries, and responsive units. For example: on mobile, the game interface and text stack vertically with tap-friendly buttons; on desktop, there could be more whitespace or a side-by-side layout.
	•	Modern UI Components: Utilize Shadcn Nuxt components (Radix Vue + Tailwind CSS) for building the UI. These components come with built-in accessibility and can be themed. We’ll use them for things like modals/dialogs (for game dialogs or pop-ups), buttons, forms (for quiz answers), progress indicators, etc., ensuring a consistent look-and-feel.
	•	Single-Player Game Logic: The game does not require multi-player or server-side state. All gameplay runs locally. When the user starts a game, a set of accessibility issues is loaded (from a static JSON or hardcoded data). The user’s score and progress reset each session. No leaderboard or online score keeping is needed.
	•	Points and Scoring: Gamify the experience by awarding points for each correctly fixed issue. For example, each accessibility error identified and corrected yields +10 points. If the user attempts a fix and it’s incorrect, they might get 0 points for that item (and possibly a chance to try again or see the correct answer). The interface should display the current score and maybe the number of issues remaining to fix. There is no cumulative scoring beyond the single game session.
	•	Compliance with 2025 Standards: All the accessibility issues presented in the game and their solutions will reflect the official standards (EN 301 549 / WCAG 2.1 AA) mandated by the European Accessibility Act ￼. This ensures that the content is relevant and up-to-date with the legislation coming into effect in 2025. For instance, missing alt text, poor color contrast, and lack of proper form labels are exactly the types of barriers these standards address ￼ ￼.
	•	No Persistent Data: As specified, no database will be used. The app does not store user data or scores on a server. This simplifies development: all state can be managed in Vue’s reactive state or in browser memory. If needed, localStorage can be used to remember a past high score or settings on the same device, but this is optional.
	•	Good UX Practices: The game should be easy and enjoyable to use. This includes: clear typography (easy-to-read fonts, adequate sizing especially on mobile), clear instructions/prompts, feedback for user actions (e.g., a sound or visual indicator when an issue is fixed), and minimal frustration on mistakes (offer hints or allow retries). The design will follow UX best practices to keep users engaged and not overwhelmed (short paragraphs, friendly language, and a logical flow).

Game Flow & Mechanics
	1.	Landing/Welcome: The user lands on the home screen of the app. Here they see the game’s title, a brief description or tagline, and a prominent “Start Game” button. For example:
	•	Title: Accessible Game Jam
	•	Tagline: “An online mini-game where you earn points by fixing accessibility errors on a fictional interface. Gamify your knowledge of accessibility and prove learning it can be fun!” (This is the English version of the provided French description and slogan.)
	•	Perhaps a brief intro: “Identify and correct as many accessibility issues as you can on the example webpage to rack up points. No sign-up needed – just play!”
	•	The landing might also have a secondary button or link to “How to Play” or “About Accessibility” for users who want instructions or context (details below).
	2.	Starting the Game: When the user clicks “Start Game”, the application transitions to the game interface. This could be a new page route or a dynamic component shown in place. There might be a quick tutorial prompt if it’s the user’s first time (e.g., a tooltip or modal overlay explaining “There are X accessibility bugs on this page. Tap on an element that looks wrong to fix it!”). The user can dismiss this and begin.
	3.	Game Interface (Challenge Screen): This is the core of the app. The screen is divided into two main parts:
	•	The Mock Interface: A panel or container that represents a fictitious webpage UI with intentional accessibility errors. This could visually look like a simple webpage – e.g., a header, some text content, images, buttons, links, a form, etc. – but with several accessibility mistakes injected. The user will inspect this area to find issues.
	•	Instruction/Status Panel: A sidebar or overlay (depending on screen size – on mobile it might be a collapsible panel above or below the mock interface) that shows instructions, score, and possibly a list of issues found/remaining. For example, it might say “Find the 5 accessibility issues hidden in this page. Score: 0. Issues fixed: 0/5.” This panel can also provide a “Hint” button if the user is stuck (e.g., highlighting an area with an issue or giving a textual clue), though hints usage might reduce points (this feature is optional but adds UX value).
Interaction Mechanics: The user explores the mock interface to spot accessibility problems. When they think they’ve found one, they will interact with it to “fix” it:
	•	On desktop: the user can click on the element that seems problematic. For example, click on an image that might be missing alt text, or on text that is hard to read, etc.
	•	On mobile: the user can tap on the element. (Ensure elements or regions are large enough to tap, or allow zooming/panning if needed.)
When the user selects an element that indeed has an accessibility issue, one of two things can happen:
	•	Direct Fix (Simpler): The app immediately registers it as a correct find, awards the points, and maybe visually updates that element (e.g., outlines it in green or replaces it with an improved version). For example, if they tap an image with missing alt, a small label “Alt text added!” could appear as feedback.
	•	Quiz Fix (Recommended): The app opens a small dialog/modal or popover at that element with a short quiz or input related to fixing the issue. This is more interactive and educational. For example: “This image is missing alternative text. How would you fix it?” and provide multiple-choice answers:
	•	a) “Add an alt attribute describing the image” (Correct)
	•	b) “Nothing, images don’t need text” (Incorrect)
	•	c) “Remove the image entirely” (Incorrect)
The user selects an answer and submits. They then receive feedback: if correct, points are awarded; if wrong, perhaps a brief note why it’s wrong and maybe a chance to try again or the correct answer is shown. The element is then marked as fixed in the UI. (The dialog could also contain a brief explanation: e.g., “Correct! Alternative text ensures screen reader users know what the image conveys, which is required for accessibility ￼.”)
The game continues with the user hunting for other issues on the page. If the user clicks something that is not actually an issue (a false alarm), provide gentle feedback like a shake or a message “This item is fine. Keep looking!” – but no penalty (or optionally a very small point deduction to discourage random clicks).
	4.	Completing the Game: Once the user has fixed all the designated issues, the game triggers the completion sequence:
	•	All issues are now marked as resolved on the mock interface (could show checkmarks on them or just the UI now looks “correct”).
	•	The user is shown a Results Screen (or a modal overlay on top of the game screen) summarizing their performance.
	5.	Results Screen: This screen displays the final score and feedback. It should include:
	•	Score Summary: e.g., “Score: 40/50 points” in large text. Also, perhaps “You fixed 4 out of 5 issues” if they missed any.
	•	Performance Message: A tailored message based on score. Examples:
	•	If perfect or high score: “Excellent! You caught all the accessibility issues. You’re an accessibility champion 🏆.”
	•	If medium: “Good job! You found most issues, but a few slipped by. Practice makes perfect – give it another try!”
	•	If low: “You fixed some issues, but there are more to find. Want to play again and see what you missed?”
	•	List of Issues and Solutions: (This is optional but very educational.) Display each issue that was in the game, with a short explanation of what the problem was and how to fix it correctly. For example:
	1.	Missing Alt Text on the hero image – Solution: Add a descriptive alt attribute so screen readers can announce the image ￼.
	2.	Low Contrast on tagline text – Solution: Ensure text color has sufficient contrast (at least 4.5:1 ratio) with its background ￼.
	3.	Form input with no label – Solution: Provide a visible text label or aria-label for form fields so users know what to input ￼.
	4.	“Click here” link text – Solution: Use descriptive link text (e.g., “View pricing details”) instead of non-contextual text like “click here” ￼.
	5.	Button not focusable – Solution: Use a proper <button> element or add necessary attributes so it’s keyboard-focusable and announced by assistive tech.
(The exact issues will match those in the game; see next section for full list.)
This list helps the user learn from any mistakes. It can be presented in an accordion or collapsible format if space is tight (each issue expandable to see the explanation).
	•	Play Again Button: A clear call-to-action to replay: “🔄 Play Again”. Since there is no leaderboard or progression tracking, replaying is the only way to improve. On clicking replay, the game can either restart with the same set of issues (allowing the user to try for a perfect score) or possibly load a new scenario if multiple are available (see below).
	6.	Optional – Multiple Scenarios/Levels: In v1, a single scenario (one page with a fixed set of issues) might be used. In future or if desired, the game could include multiple scenarios or levels (e.g., Level 1: a simple page with 3 issues, Level 2: a more complex page with 5 issues, etc.). If implementing this, the Home screen could let the user select a scenario or difficulty. Each level would be a variation with different content but similar mechanics. However, to keep scope manageable, the initial version can have one scenario; the “Play Again” simply restarts that scenario (users might play until they get a perfect score). No level selection UI is needed in the first iteration.

Screens & UI Details

Home Screen (Landing Page)
	•	Layout: A simple, welcoming screen on app launch. Centered content for larger screens; full-screen stacked content on mobile. Likely just one scrollable view (no complex navigation).
	•	Title & Branding: The game’s name “Accessible Game Jam” prominently displayed (e.g., as an <h1> at the top). Possibly accompanied by a small logo or icon (if available – e.g., an icon suggesting accessibility or a game).
	•	Description/Tagline: A brief description in a paragraph or two. For example: “A mini online game where you earn points by fixing accessibility mistakes on a pretend web interface. Sharpen your accessibility skills in a fun way!” Keep this text concise and engaging.
	•	Start Button: A large, primary call-to-action button labeled “Start Game” (using a Shadcn/Nuxt button component). This should be highly visible (contrasting color, perhaps full width on mobile for easy tapping). When pressed, it triggers the transition to the game screen.
	•	How to Play (Optional): If users might need more instruction, include a smaller secondary button or link, e.g., “How to Play” or an info icon. This could open a modal or navigate to an instruction overlay. The instructions would explain the basics: “You will be shown a webpage with several accessibility errors. Tap on anything you think is an issue and follow the prompts to fix it. Earn points for each correct fix. Find them all to maximize your score.” If the game is intuitive enough, this section can be minimal. Alternatively, the first game playthrough can incorporate these instructions as guided tips rather than a separate screen.
	•	Responsive behavior: On mobile, content is centered and possibly the description text is slightly smaller; the Start button is large and near the bottom for easy tapping. On desktop/tablet, maybe the Start button is to the side of a graphic. Ensure that the focus order is logical (tabbing should go through Start last).

Game Screen (Interactive Challenge)
	•	Layout: This screen fills the viewport and contains the interactive mock interface plus side/top UI elements for status.
	•	On mobile (narrow width): Place the status/score display at the top and the interactive interface below it (vertical stacking). The user may need to scroll within the interface if it’s tall (like a webpage). Ensure the score/status bar remains visible (it could be a sticky top bar). The interactive elements should be sized for mobile (e.g., use a mobile viewport width for the mock page so it’s not tiny).
	•	On desktop/tablet (wider): You can show the mock interface in a phone-sized frame in the center and the instructions/score on a side panel. Or have the instruction panel above the interface. As long as it looks balanced. Possibly use a two-column layout: left 70% for the mock page, right 30% for score/instructions, if width allows.
	•	Mock Interface Details: This is essentially a fake webpage UI embedded within the game. It can be built with standard HTML elements styled to look like a typical site. For authenticity and to allow actual interaction, it should use real semantic elements (images, headings, buttons, etc.), but deliberately include some accessibility faults. The content might simulate, for example, a simple blog or landing page.
	•	Example structure: A header with a title, a hero image, a welcome text, a few paragraphs, a sign-up form (with an email field and submit button), some navigation links or article links, etc.
	•	The visual design of the mock page should be clear enough for users to spot anomalies (e.g., if text is very low contrast, it will be visibly hard to read; if a form field has no label, it will just show a placeholder with no label text). Use realistic lorem ipsum or short dummy content for realism.
	•	We might also visually indicate to the player how many issues there are (maybe not directly on the page, but via the UI text: e.g., “There are 5 issues” so they know how many to hunt for).
	•	Each interactive element in this area that is meant to be clicked should have some affordance (like the cursor changes on hover for desktop, or a subtle highlight on focus) to hint it’s clickable. We will likely wrap each “issue element” in a button or attach a click handler via Vue to capture user clicks. Non-issue elements could either be inert or also clickable but just not trigger points (then the game logic will handle it as a wrong guess).
	•	Status/Score Display: A small UI element showing current score (e.g., “Score: 0” initially) and possibly issues remaining (e.g., “Issues left: 5”). This should update in real-time as the user fixes issues. For instance, “Score: 10 – Issues left: 4” after fixing one. This can be simply text or stylized badge elements. It should be visually distinct and often placed in a corner or header area.
	•	Instructions/Hints: An area for dynamic messages, such as a one-line instruction: “Tap an element that might be inaccessible.” This can also be used to display hints if the user requests them. For example, if a user taps the hint button, the instruction text could change to “Hint: Check the image at the top of the page,” or a subtle glow/highlight could appear around the problematic image. (Implementing highlight: you could add a CSS class that adds a glowing outline around the element with an issue for a second.) Hints usage can be limited to maintain challenge.
	•	Feedback Modal/Popover: When a user finds an issue, as mentioned, show a small popover or modal for the quiz/confirmation. Design of this dialog: Use a Shadcn dialog or popover component. It should contain:
	•	A short heading or question (e.g., “Issue: No Alt Text” or “Fix the image description”).
	•	The question or prompt text and possibly the element in question (maybe a thumbnail of the image or the text in question, to provide context).
	•	Answer input: likely multiple-choice buttons (radio buttons or a list of buttons). Could also be a small text input if needed (but then we need exact matching logic or just treat any non-empty input as success for things like “add alt text”, which is less precise). Multiple-choice is simpler to implement and ensures a correct vs incorrect validation easily.
	•	Submit/Confirm button: if using radio options, a submit button to lock in the answer (or if using buttons as options, clicking one can immediately count as answer). Use a consistent style (primary button for submit).
	•	On submission, indicate correct/incorrect: e.g., show a green check icon and “Correct!” or a red cross “Not quite.” Possibly this can be just a text in the same dialog or a slight color change. For wrong answers, allow the user to try again or provide the correct answer after one wrong attempt to keep things moving.
	•	A brief explanation text (especially on correct, or after the correct answer is revealed) reinforcing the learning point. For example: “Images need alternative text so that screen reader users know what the image is. Without alt text, this image was invisible to them. ￼”. Keep explanations to 1-2 sentences.
	•	A “Continue” button to close the dialog and return to the game (or automatically close after 2 seconds of showing a “Correct!” message, to keep flow).
	•	Visual Feedback on the Mock Interface: After fixing an issue, the mock interface element might visibly change to reflect the fix, which helps the user see progress. Some ideas:
	•	Overlay a small checkmark on that element or change its styling. Example: an image border turns green once alt text is “added” (though alt text isn’t visible, the visual indicator shows the fix). For a low-contrast text issue, after fixing, actually change the text color in the mock interface to a higher contrast color so it’s visibly solved. This reinforces the idea that the issue is addressed and also makes the page more “complete”.
	•	Alternatively, replace the problematic element with a corrected version. E.g., if originally there was a “Click here” link, after fix it could literally change its label to “Download report” or whatever the correct text is, in the UI. This real-time correction makes the game feel interactive and rewarding (the page becomes fully accessible by the end). Implement this by binding the element’s content to a reactive state that updates when the user answers correctly.
	•	Error Handling: If any unexpected issue occurs (e.g., the user triggers a bug or tries to do something out of order), ensure the app doesn’t freeze. Possibly have a generic message or reset. Since it’s a simple flow, robust error handling might just be providing a “Reset Game” option in a menu or on the results screen if something goes wrong or if the user wants to start over mid-game.

Results Screen
	•	Layout: Could be a separate view or an overlay modal on the game screen once completed. It should be center-focused, with a congrats message and summary. Use celebratory visuals like an emoji or icon (trophy, star, etc.) to make it feel rewarding.
	•	Score Display: Big and clear. e.g., “Your Score: 40/50”. Possibly also display a rating or stars (if we want to give, say, 5 stars for a perfect score, etc., though not required).
	•	Message: A paragraph summarizing performance as described earlier. Keep tone encouraging and positive. Even if the score is low, emphasize what they learned and motivate retry.
	•	Issues Recap: As mentioned, a list of issues and correct solutions. This can be an accordion list or simply a bulleted list with brief explanations. If space is a concern on mobile, a simple list of “Issue – Solution” pairs is fine (possibly scrollable).
	•	Play Again button: A prominent button to restart. If multiple scenarios were to exist, this might instead say “Back to Home” to choose a level. But in a single-scenario setup, “Play Again” can directly reload the game state. The app should reset any necessary state (score back to 0, issues reset to unresolved). Possibly also a small text link “Return to Home” if they want to go back to the landing page.
	•	Social Sharing (Optional): Although no leaderboard, we could optionally include a share button (e.g., “Tweet your score”). This would be purely client-side (no backend) and just opens the OS share sheet or a pre-composed tweet with text like “I scored 40/50 on Accessible Game Jam! Try the web accessibility challenge yourself.” This can help spread the app but is not a core requirement. If implementing, ensure any sharing features are accessible and don’t expose emails or personal data (since we have none).

Additional Screens/Components
	•	How to Play / Info Modal: If the user clicks a “How to Play” or an info icon, display a brief overlay (could be a modal using Shadcn dialog). Include 2-3 steps with an illustration or icon if available. For example:
	1.	Explore the page: Look for things that might be problematic for accessibility (hard to read text, missing descriptions, etc.).
	2.	Tap to fix: Click/tap an element that seems wrong, and choose the correct fix in the prompt.
	3.	Score points: Earn 10 points for each correct fix. Fix all issues to win!
Mention that these issues align with real web accessibility standards (so the game also serves as practice for WCAG compliance). Keep this modal dismissible (a clear close button).
	•	Accessibility Info Page (Optional): A section that perhaps explains what the 2025 EU directive or WCAG is, for those interested. This could be a simple static page or modal with a summary and links. For example: “This game is based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA, which are part of the European Accessibility requirements effective from 2025 ￼. Common issues include missing alt text, low color contrast, missing form labels, etc., which can prevent people with disabilities from using a site ￼ ￼. We hope this game raises awareness of these issues in a fun way.” And provide a link to resources (like W3C or a brief mention that “For more info, see W3C’s WCAG documentation or the European Accessibility Act details.”). This section isn’t critical but adds educational value.
	•	Credits/Footer: A small footer or credits note can be included (e.g., “Built with Nuxt 3 and Shadcn UI. Accessibility standards © W3C. Game design by …”). On mobile it can be very minimal or hidden behind an “About” link to avoid cluttering the main screens.

Sample Accessibility Issues and Fixes (Game Content)

To design the game scenario, we outline the specific accessibility errors that will be present in the mock interface. These are drawn from common real-world problems that the European standards aim to eliminate. The developer will implement these as part of the mock page, and ensure the game logic recognizes them when clicked. Below is a list of five core issues to include, with their correct solutions and how they might appear in game:
	1.	Missing Alternative Text for Image:
	•	In the mock UI: There is a meaningful image (e.g., a banner or an illustration) with an empty or missing alt attribute. Visually, there might be no obvious caption or description. (We may add a subtle clue like a decorative filename showing, but ideally it looks normal to sighted users – the challenge is knowing it needs alt text.)
	•	Gameplay: When the user clicks the image, the quiz dialog appears: “This image has no alt text. What should be done?” with options like:
a) “Add a descriptive alt attribute to the <img> tag.” (Correct)
b) “Nothing, images don’t require alt text if they look nice.” (Incorrect)
c) “Only provide alt text if the image is a photo of text.” (Incorrect)
	•	Fix Outcome: After answering correctly, award points and possibly overlay a small icon on the image (like a text icon) or simply note “Alt text added.” In the issue recap, explain that every informative image needs equivalent text for screen reader users ￼.
	2.	Insufficient Color Contrast:
	•	In the mock UI: Some text is styled in a very low-contrast color (e.g., light gray text on a white background, or yellow text on light background). For instance, a subtitle or disclaimer might be deliberately hard to read. This should be visibly straining to read – an attentive user will likely suspect it.
	•	Gameplay: Clicking that text or its container triggers a prompt: “The text ‘Welcome to our site’ appears in a light color that is hard to read. What’s the issue?” The correct answer: “The color contrast is too low, it fails accessibility guidelines” vs distractors like “The font size is too large” or “It’s using an uncommon font.” Alternatively, the question could be phrased as “How would you fix this text’s accessibility issue?” with answer: “Use a text color/background with sufficient contrast (at least 4.5:1 ratio)” (Correct) ￼, vs “Underline the text” (irrelevant) or “No fix needed – looks fine” (wrong).
	•	Fix Outcome: On correction, increase the text contrast in the UI (e.g., switch the text to black or a darker color) to demonstrate the fix. Score points. In recap, note that low contrast text is a common barrier and WCAG requires a minimum contrast of about 4.5:1 for normal text ￼.
	3.	Form Field Without Label:
	•	In the mock UI: Include a simple form, e.g., a newsletter sign-up with an email input and submit button. Deliberately leave the <input> without a <label> element. It might rely on a placeholder like “Email address” as the only hint. Visually, users see the placeholder and might not notice anything wrong, but accessibility-wise, a proper label is missing.
	•	Gameplay: If the user clicks on or near the form input (or perhaps the form area in general), prompt them: “This form field doesn’t have a label. Why is this an issue?” or “How can we make this form field accessible?” Correct answer: “Add a visible text label (or an aria-label) for the input describing its purpose” ￼. Wrong options could be “It’s fine as long as a placeholder is there” or “Make the text placeholder darker.”
	•	Fix Outcome: After fixing, the mock interface can be updated to show a label, e.g., a label “Email:” appears before the input (indicating the field is now properly labeled). In the recap, explain that form controls must have labels so that users (especially screen reader users) know what information to input ￼.
	4.	Non-Descriptive Link Text (“Click Here”):
	•	In the mock UI: Include a hyperlink that uses generic text like “Click here” or “Read more” without context. For example: a sentence “To learn more about our services, click here.” where “click here” is the link. This is a known bad practice because screen reader users or anyone skimming links won’t know what “click here” leads to ￼. Possibly include multiple “Read more” links under article teasers to emphasize the ambiguity.
	•	Gameplay: When the user clicks the link text, ask: “This link just says ‘Click here.’ What’s the accessibility problem?” Correct: “The link text isn’t descriptive of its purpose/destination” ￼. Or if phrased as “How to fix?” then: “Change the link text to something meaningful (e.g., ‘Read more about our services’)”.
	•	Fix Outcome: After answer, update the link’s text in the mock page to a better text (for example, the link now literally changes to “Learn about our services”). The score increases. Recap explanation: Link text should make sense out of context. Avoid vague phrases; instead, describe what will happen if the link is clicked ￼.
	5.	Inaccessible Button (No Keyboard Access or Label):
	•	In the mock UI: There is a button or interactive element that is implemented incorrectly. For instance, a “Submit” button that is actually a <div> with an onClick handler, or an icon-only button (like a search icon 🔍 with no screen reader label). Visually it might look like a button, but because it’s not a real <button>, it might not focus via keyboard and has no accessible name. Users tabbing through the page would skip it, and screen readers might not recognize it.
	•	Gameplay: When the user clicks this element (which they can with a mouse/tap, but a keyboard user couldn’t – the irony is they are likely using a mouse to play), the prompt might be: “This interactive element isn’t properly accessible. What’s wrong?” Potential answers:
	•	“It’s not built with a proper HTML button or link, so it can’t be focused or announced.” (Correct)
	•	“It’s too small.” (Incorrect as an accessibility issue, though small size might be UX issue)
	•	“No issue, it works when clicked.” (Incorrect, missing the point)
	•	Alternatively, specifically: “The submit element cannot be activated by keyboard. How would you fix it?” Correct: “Use a <button> element or add tabindex/role to make it keyboard-accessible and give it an ARIA-label if icon-only.”
	•	Fix Outcome: After fixing, we could simply consider it resolved (perhaps change the styling to show a focus outline if tabbed, though that might not be directly observable in this context). In recap, explain that all interactive controls should be proper HTML buttons/links or given roles, and should be focusable via keyboard. This ensures people who can’t use a mouse can still use the UI.

These five issues cover a range of principles (text alternatives, visual design, semantics, navigation, and content). They reflect common problems web developers should avoid ￼ ￼. The developer should implement each in the mock page and ensure the game logic (click handlers and quiz content) correspond exactly. The text of questions/answers given above are examples – they can be adjusted for wording and length, but the correct solution should remain clear.

Note: All in-game text (questions, answers, explanations, buttons) should be written in plain, easy-to-understand English. Avoid overly technical jargon in questions; the game is meant to “vulgarize without boring,” i.e., simplify the knowledge for a broad audience. However, do use proper terms in explanations (like “alternative text” or “contrast ratio”) with a brief explanation as needed.

Accessibility & UX Considerations

Because this application’s purpose is to promote accessibility, it’s critical that the app itself demonstrates excellent accessibility and UX. The following considerations must be observed during development:
	•	Keyboard Navigation: All interactive components (start button, game elements, modal dialogs, etc.) must be reachable and operable via keyboard alone. For instance, users should be able to press “Enter” or “Space” to activate the Start button, use “Tab” to navigate through clickable issue elements on the game screen, and answer quiz dialogs with keyboard (arrow keys to select an option and Enter to submit, for example). Ensure focus is managed: when a dialog opens, focus should move into it; when it closes, focus returns to a logical place (e.g., back to the element or a next element).
	•	Focus Indicators: Use visible focus outlines on focused elements (relying on browser defaults or customizing via Tailwind). Do not remove outline without providing an equivalent. This ensures users who navigate by keyboard can see where they are. (Shadcn components typically handle focus states well by default.)
	•	Responsive Text & Layout: Use relative units (rem/em) for font sizes so that if the user zooms the page or increases text size, the layout can accommodate it (text shouldn’t overflow out of containers, etc.). Test on small and large screens and at different zoom levels (up to 200% zoom as per WCAG).
	•	Color and Contrast: Aside from the intentional low-contrast issue within the game content, all actual game UI elements (buttons, text, backgrounds) should meet color contrast guidelines. Choose a color scheme that is high contrast for text vs background (at least 4.5:1 for normal text ￼). Also ensure color is not the sole means of conveying information in the UI. For example, if indicating a wrong answer, don’t just use red text – also show an icon or text “Incorrect” so that color-blind users or screen reader users get the feedback.
	•	Screen Reader Labels: All interactive controls need proper labeling. E.g., the Start Game button should read “Start Game”. If using icon buttons (like maybe a hint icon or a close “X” icon on modals), include aria-label attributes (Shadcn should allow adding accessible labels). For the game’s mock interface elements: even though some are intentionally faulty, consider how a screen reader user could play. One approach: provide a hidden description or alternate mode where the game enumerates issues in text form for blind users. However, this might give answers away. At minimum, ensure the game is not totally unplayable for a blind user – perhaps the hint system or an optional toggle “Enable screen reader mode” could list the issues as tasks. This is an area for extra credit; if not in scope, document that the game primarily targets sighted developers to educate them, but it’s good to be inclusive if possible.
	•	Timing: Avoid any strict time limits for finding issues, as that could stress users and harm accessibility (WCAG says avoid time constraints or make them adjustable). Let users play at their own pace. If adding any animations or transitions, keep them short and avoid anything that flashes intensely (to avoid seizure risks).
	•	Error Prevention & Recovery: The game should be forgiving. If a user mis-clicks or gets an answer wrong, allow them to try again or eventually reveal the answer. The goal is learning, not punishing. Also ensure that nothing in the interface can accidentally trap the user (e.g., if a dialog opens, they should always have a way to close it via a visible close button or pressing Esc).
	•	Testing: The developer should test the app with accessibility evaluation tools (like Lighthouse or Axe) and ideally with a screen reader (NVDA/VoiceOver) to ensure the container application has no glaring accessibility issues. Because we intentionally have some inaccessible elements in the mock game content, we might mark those in a way that tools can ignore (or simply be aware of them). It might be useful to include an aria-live region for game messages (so screen reader users know when they scored or finished an issue).
	•	UX Delight: While not required, small touches can improve UX: e.g., a simple sound effect on scoring (with ability to mute for those who don’t want sound), or an animation when an issue is fixed (like a quick fade-out of an error highlight). Keep such effects subtle and ensure they don’t interfere with accessibility (e.g., flashing should be avoided, sounds should have captions or at least be simple pings). Provide a way to disable animations if needed (prefers-reduced-motion CSS respect).

Technical Implementation Notes
	•	Framework: Use Nuxt 3 (Vue.js) for the project, enabling us to create a reactive single-page app experience. Nuxt’s file-based routing can handle pages like the home and game if needed, or it can all be one page with conditional rendering. Since no external data fetching is required (aside from maybe static JSON for issues), the app can be fully static-deployment friendly.
	•	Components & State: Plan components such as: <HomePage>, <GamePage>, <ResultModal> (or page), <IssueDialog> (for the quiz popup), and child components for the mock interface (maybe split into <MockPage> containing sub-components like <MockHeader>, <MockForm>, etc., or just hardcode the structure in one component since it’s small). Use Vue’s reactive data() or setup() state to track score, remaining issues, etc.
	•	Shadcn-Nuxt Integration: After installing the Shadcn Nuxt module, use its components like <Button>, <Dialog>, <AlertDialog>, etc., to build UI elements. These come pre-styled with Tailwind and follow Radix UI’s accessibility. Customize the theme (colors, fonts) via Tailwind config to match any desired branding (maybe a nice accessible color palette, e.g., blues or purples with good contrast).
	•	Game Data: Define the set of issues and their content in a structured way. For example, an array of issue objects:

issues: [
  {
    id: 'missing-alt',
    description: 'Image missing alt text',
    elementSelector: '#hero-img',  // or a reference to the element in the mock UI
    question: 'What is missing from this image to make it accessible?',
    options: [
       { text: 'An alt attribute describing the image', correct: true },
       { text: 'A decorative border around the image', correct: false },
       { text: 'Nothing, it is fine as is', correct: false }
    ],
    feedback: 'Correct! Adding an alt attribute provides a text description for screen readers.',
    fixedAction: () => {/* code to add alt text or mark fixed in UI */}
  },
  // ... other issues
]

This way, the game logic can iterate through this list. Each issue has the info needed for the quiz and also a way to mark the UI fixed (e.g., maybe storing the “fixed” state and the UI reacts to that). Alternatively, the mock interface elements themselves could be bound to a reactive property like isAltFixed etc. Simpler might be to swap CSS classes or innerText on fix.

	•	Mock Interface Construction: You can either hard-code the HTML for the mock page in the template with identifiable IDs or classes for each element, or generate it from data. Hard-coding is fine here (just ensure to mark which ones have issues). Example:

<div class="mock-page">
  <h2>Welcome to Our Site</h2>
  <img id="hero-img" src="hero.jpg" alt="" />  <!-- alt intentionally empty -->
  <p id="tagline" style="color: #aaa;">This is the best place to learn!</p>  <!-- low contrast text -->
  <p>We offer great resources. <a id="learn-link" href="#">Click here</a> to learn more.</p>  <!-- vague link -->
  <form id="signup-form">
     <!-- No label for input below -->
     <input type="email" placeholder="Email address" />
     <div id="submit-btn" @click="...">Submit</div>  <!-- non-semantic button -->
  </form>
</div>

(The above is illustrative – in Vue template, use @click and data binding appropriately.)
Each problematic element should have an id or unique identifier so the game logic can map it to an issue. Also, ensure non-issue elements (like the h2 or other text) don’t accidentally trigger any game logic when clicked. We might overlay an invisible clickable layer on top of each issue element to handle clicks, or simply add @click on those specific elements.

	•	Routing: If using Nuxt pages, we might have / for home and /game for the game (and maybe /result if not using modal). However, a single-page experience is also fine: when Start is clicked, we set a state like gameStarted=true and conditionally render the game screen. Simpler for now might be one route for game and we show/hide sections with v-if. Up to developer preference.
	•	State Management: Vue’s reactivity should suffice. The score and count of fixed issues are simple numbers. For tracking which issues are fixed, we can have a boolean in each issue object or a separate fixedIds set. The quiz dialogs can be controlled by a state like activeIssue which is set when an issue is clicked and cleared when done. Nuxt’s built-in store (Pinia) is optional for such a small app, but could be used if desired.
	•	No Server Calls: Ensure that all assets (images for the mock interface, etc.) are packaged with the app. No need for API calls. If we include external links (like the W3C references in an info page), that’s fine but they open in new tab.
	•	Testing & Debugging: Before finalizing, test the game thoroughly:
	•	On various screen sizes (using dev tools responsive mode).
	•	With keyboard only: ensure you can start the game, tab to issues (this might require adding a tabindex to elements that aren’t naturally focusable like div if we want keyboard users to find them – or we can simulate by having a hidden list of “Next issue” buttons? Something to ponder. Perhaps better: allow a cheat for keyboard mode: pressing Tab highlights each issue one by one in some logical order. Or simply ensure our interactive elements are <button> or <a> so they are focusable by default).
	•	With a screen reader (to see that our labels and roles make sense).
	•	Run an automated accessibility checker (bearing in mind it will flag our intentional issues – we might ignore those or disable checks in the mock container). The main app UI should pass.

By adhering to these technical notes and the feature details above, the developer will be able to build Accessible Game Jam as a polished, user-friendly application. The end result will be a responsive web game that not only provides an enjoyable challenge but also spreads awareness about accessibility best practices – helping web creators prepare for the European accessibility requirements of 2025 while having fun.
